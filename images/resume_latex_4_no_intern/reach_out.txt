
Hello Nasrin,

Many thanks for accepting my connection request. I hope you don’t mind me reaching out to you through LinkedIn. I’m applying for the Data Scientist job at your company, and I wanted to take a minute to say hello.

I’m a big fan of smart grid ML/AI applications, and my skillset seems like a great fit for the role. For the past four years, I was extensively involved in machine learning applications, mainly in power transmission and power demand. I’ve included both my resume and a cover letter in my job application for your kind consideration.

Thanks for your time, and I’m looking forward to hearning from you.

Kind regards,
Samer
